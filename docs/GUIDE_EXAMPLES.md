# LGFXVirtualCanvas — Example workflow

Render tiled screens with a bounded drawing buffer.

Check installation and platform requirements in the [library README](../README.md), then choose a sketch from the [example index](../examples/README.md). Version/support tables and internal capacity defaults stay in their original reference rather than being duplicated here.

## From setup to a verified result

1. Choose the smallest relevant sketch and check its board, hardware, dependencies and bundled files.
2. Match pins, peers and input files to your actual setup. Each README identifies important placeholders.
3. Open the .ino, select board/port and upload. Match Serial baud where used.
4. Locate the last completed stage: initialization, input, processing or output. Compilation does not test hardware I/O.
5. Reproduce the supplied example before changing one setting at a time.

## API and data handling

Initialize the real panel before allocating the virtual screen/sprite. A render callback can run once per tile: it must draw the same scene snapshot without advancing animation, consuming input or doing one-shot I/O inside it. Update state outside the callback, then render.

Screen coordinates cover the virtual screen; sprite coordinates are local to its viewport. A memory limit bounds tile storage, not every allocation in the application. Check begin/render outcomes and inspect tile/PSRAM diagnostics rather than assuming requested memory came from a particular region.

Diff mode reduces transfers, not callback execution; after drawing directly to the panel, invalidate the cached comparison before relying on it. Transparent drawing leaves skipped pixels untouched and does not restore the covered background when an overlay closes.

## When adapting it

- Distinguish bool status, processed counts and handles; do not use stale output after failure.
- Registered callbacks run later from their documented context. Decide synchronization and retained-data lifetime.
- Keep bytes, samples, frames and pixels distinct; capacity is different from valid length.
- Retain views/pointers/buffers for the required period. Copying a pointer does not copy its payload.
- Add application-specific failure handling, retry and cleanup that a minimal example may omit.

## Read the individual README

Use Prepare and run for hardware and steps, Follow the sketch for the actual APIs and precautions for feature-specific constraints. If output is missing, check initialization first, continued service calls next and input/peer readiness after that.
